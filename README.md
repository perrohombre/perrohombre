### ðŸ“Š Thesis Project
 I'm currently working on my thesis project, a microservices-based application for analyzing soccer player skills. This app combines Java Spring Boot, Python microservices for machine learning and data analysis, and PostgreSQL for data storage. It features a React frontend with a Text2SQL chatbot, player ranking, and skill clustering, all orchestrated with Kubernetes. CI/CD is managed through GitHub Actions and ArgoCD to ensure efficient deployment and updates.
